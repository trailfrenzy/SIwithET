The meter (m) is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum c to be 299,792,458 when expressed in the unit m s?1, where the second is defined in terms of ??Cs.

The meter was once defined by a physical artifact - two marks inscribed on a platinum-iridium bar. The Length - Evolution from Measurement Standard to a Fundamental Constant explains the evolution of the definition of the meter. Follow these changes over time in the NIST Length Timeline .

From the meter, several other units of measure are derived such as the:

unit of speed is the meter per second (m/s). The speed of light in vacuum is 299 792 458 meters per second.
unit of acceleration is the meter per second per second (m/s2).
unit of area is the square meter (m2).
unit of volume is the cubic meter (m3). The liter (1 cubic decimeter), although not an SI unit, is accepted for use with the SI and is commonly used to measure fluid volume.
